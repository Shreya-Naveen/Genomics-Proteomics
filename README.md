# üß¨ Genomics & Proteomics Project - Lambda Virus Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the **lambda virus genome** using **Biopython**, with a focus on understanding sequence composition, genomic behavior, and alignment accuracy. The project explores how **AT-rich regions** influence transcription and how introducing **mismatches in sequence alignment** improves biological insight.

---

## üß™ Project Objectives

- Analyze a lambda virus FASTA sequence.
- Determine the base composition and implications of AT-rich DNA.
- Perform pairwise alignments and compare results with and without mismatch allowances.
- Use NCBI BLAST for sequence similarity analysis.
- Understand how mismatches affect read alignment offsets.

---

## üîç Key Findings

- The lambda virus genome is significantly **AT-rich**, which may influence **gene silencing** and **transcription regulation**.
- Allowing mismatches in alignment improved detection from position **530** to **430**, showcasing the benefit of tolerance in biological sequence matching.
- AT-rich sequences may represent **regulatory** or **heterochromatin regions**.

## üìö Learnings

This project offered practical insights into:

- How viral sequences behave at the chromatin level.
- Why **exact sequence matches** may fail to capture biologically relevant hits.
- How **computational genomics** supports **proteomics interpretations**.
